# Code Review

Pros
+ Efficient (lines of code kept to a minimum)

Cons
+ Use of btn prefix
+ Use of "on" before event names
+ Inconsistent function naming ("btn..." vs "open...")
+ Lint errors
- Double quotes
- Missing semicolons 
- Space after colon in declarations
- One line else and {  with if 
- Space after if before left paren
- Do not use "on" (no-output-on-prefix)
